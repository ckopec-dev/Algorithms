# Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm Implementation

The Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is used to find all maximal cliques in an undirected graph.

## Python Implementation

```python

        r: current clique being built

    cliques = []
    
    # Iterate through potential vertices (copy to avoid modifying during iteration)
    for vertex in list(p):
        # Add vertex to current clique
        new_r = r + [vertex]
        # Get neighbors of the vertex
        neighbors = graph[vertex]

## Alternative Implementation with Better Performance

```python
def bron_kerbosch_optimized(r, p, x, graph, cliques=None):
    """
    Optimized Bron-Kerbosch algorithm using sets for better performance
    """
    if cliques is None:

    # If no more vertices can be added, we found a maximal clique
    if not p and not x:

        return cliques
    
    # Choose pivot vertex from union of p and x
    u = next(iter(p.union(x)))
    
    # Iterate through potential vertices that are not adjacent to pivot
    for vertex in list(p - set(graph[u])):
        # Add vertex to current clique
        new_r = r | {vertex}
        # Get neighbors of the vertex
        neighbors = set(graph[vertex])

        new_p = p & neighbors
        # Find intersection of excluded vertices and neighbors
        new_x = x & neighbors
        
        # Recursively find cliques with this vertex included
        bron_kerbosch_optimized(new_r, new_p, new_x, graph, cliques)
        
        # Remove vertex from potential and add to excluded
        p.remove(vertex)
        x.add(vertex)
    
    return cliques

def find_maximal_cliques_optimized(graph):
    """
    Optimized version using sets for better performance
    """
    # Convert graph to adjacency list format if needed
    if not isinstance(graph, dict):
        adj_list = {}
        for i in range(len(graph)):
            adj_list[i] = [j for j in range(len(graph)) if graph[i][j] == 1]
        graph = adj_list
    
    # Start with empty clique, all vertices as potential, empty excluded
    return bron_kerbosch_optimized(set(), set(graph.keys()), set(), graph)
```

## Sample Output

```
Graph edges:
Vertex 0: [1, 3]
Vertex 1: [0, 2, 4]
Vertex 2: [1, 5]
Vertex 3: [0, 4]
Vertex 4: [1, 3, 5, 6]
Vertex 5: [2, 4]
Vertex 6: [4]

Maximal cliques found:
Clique 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Clique 2: [0, 1, 3, 4]
Clique 3: [1, 2, 4, 5]
Clique 4: [4, 6]
```

## Key Points

- **Time Complexity**: O(3^(n/3)) in worst case
- **Space Complexity**: O(nÂ²) for storing the graph
- **Input Format**: Adjacency list representation
- **Output**: All maximal cliques in the graph
- **Pruning**: Uses pivot selection to avoid redundant computations

The algorithm works by recursively building cliques and using the principle that if we cannot add any more vertices to a clique, then it's maximal.
