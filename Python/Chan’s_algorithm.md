# Chan's Algorithm for Convex Hull

Chan's algorithm is a convex hull algorithm that combines the advantages of Graham scan and divide-and-conquer approaches. It has a time complexity of O(n log h) where n is the number of points and h is the number of points on the convex hull.

## Key Features of Chan's Algorithm:

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combines the benefits of different convex hull algorithms
2. **Optimal Complexity**: O(n log h) time complexity where h is the number of hull points
3. **Practical Efficiency**: Works well for both small and large datasets
4. **Memory Efficient**: Uses minimal extra space

The algorithm works by:
1. Estimating the number of points on the convex hull
2. Using a combination of techniques to iteratively refine the hull
3. Employing a divide-and-conquer approach when necessary
4. Finalizing with a standard convex hull algorithm for small sets
