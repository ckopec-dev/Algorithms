# Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm in Assembly Language

Below is an example implementation of the Clarke-Wright savings algorithm in x86-64 Assembly language:

```assembly
.section .data
    # Distance matrix (5x5) - example distances between nodes
    distances: .long 0, 10, 15, 20, 25
               .long 10, 0, 35, 25, 30
               .long 15, 35, 0, 30, 20
               .long 20, 25, 30, 0, 15
               .long 25, 30, 20, 15, 0
    
    # Number of nodes
    num_nodes: .long 5
    
    # Savings array
    savings: .space 100  # Space for 25 savings values (5*5)
    
    # Route arrays
    route_a: .space 50   # Space for routes
    route_b: .space 50
    
    # Node flags
    node_flags: .space 5

## Key Components Explained:

### 1. **Data Section**
- `distances`: 5x5 matrix of distances between nodes
- `num_nodes`: Total number of nodes (including depot)
- `savings`: Array to store calculated savings values

### 2. **Key Functions**

**`calculate_savings`**: Computes savings using the formula:
```
S(i,j) = c(0,i) + c(0,j) - c(i,j)
```

**`clarke_wright_algorithm`**: Main algorithm implementation that:
- Calculates all pairwise savings
- Initializes routes (each node connected to depot)
- Implements route merging logic

### 3. **Algorithm Steps**
1. Calculate savings for all pairs of nodes
2. Sort savings in descending order
3. Merge routes based on highest savings values
4. Continue until no more profitable merges exist

### 4. **Assembly Features Used**
- **Register usage**: %rax, %rbx, %rcx, %rdi, %rsi, %r8
- **Memory operations**: Loading/storing from data sections
- **Control flow**: Conditional jumps and loops
- **Function calls**: Recursive-like structure with stack management

This is a simplified representation showing the core concepts. A complete implementation would include proper sorting algorithms, route merging logic, and more sophisticated memory management.
